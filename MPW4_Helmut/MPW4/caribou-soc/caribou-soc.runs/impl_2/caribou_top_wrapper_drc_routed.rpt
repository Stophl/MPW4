-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN/IBUFDS_0 (in Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN1/IBUFDS_0 (in Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN1 macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IBUFDS_inst_TLU_RST_in/IBUFDS_0 (in IBUFDS_inst_TLU_RST_in macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#4 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IBUFDS_inst_TLU_TRG_in/IBUFDS_0 (in IBUFDS_inst_TLU_TRG_in macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

RTSTAT-10#1 Warning
No routable loads  
4 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are DATA_FIFO_inst1/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/gntv_or_sync_fifo.gl0.rd/grss.rsts/ram_empty_i,

This design requires 1 of such cell types but no compatible site is available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. Please consider increasing the span of Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP' or removing cells from it.)
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-3#2 Warning
Resource utilization  - PBlock:GBE_arp_ping_UDP
RAMB18 over-utilized in Pblock GBE_arp_ping_UDP (This design requires more RAMB18 cells than are available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. This design requires 1 of such cell types but no compatible site is available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. Please consider increasing the span of Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP' or removing cells from it.)
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-3#3 Warning
Resource utilization  - PBlock:DECODE
