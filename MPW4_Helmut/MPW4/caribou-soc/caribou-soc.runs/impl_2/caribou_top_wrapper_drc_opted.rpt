2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
BUFC-1#1 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN/IBUFDS_0 (in Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#2 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN1/IBUFDS_0 (in Deser_inst/IBUFDS_DIFF_OUT_SIN1 macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#3 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IBUFDS_inst_TLU_RST_in/IBUFDS_0 (in IBUFDS_inst_TLU_RST_in macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

BUFC-1#4 Warning
Input Buffer Connections  
Input buffer IBUFDS_inst_TLU_TRG_in/IBUFDS_0 (in IBUFDS_inst_TLU_TRG_in macro) has no loads. It is recommended to have an input buffer drive an internal load.
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-3#1 Warning
Resource utilization  - PBlock:GBE_arp_ping_UDP
FIFO18 over-utilized in Pblock GBE_arp_ping_UDP (This design requires more FIFO18 cells than are available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. This design requires 1 of such cell types but no compatible site is available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. Please consider increasing the span of Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP' or removing cells from it.)
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-3#2 Warning
Resource utilization  - PBlock:GBE_arp_ping_UDP
RAMB18 over-utilized in Pblock GBE_arp_ping_UDP (This design requires more RAMB18 cells than are available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. This design requires 1 of such cell types but no compatible site is available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. Please consider increasing the span of Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP' or removing cells from it.)
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-3#3 Warning
Resource utilization  - PBlock:DECODE
RAMB36/FIFO over-utilized in Pblock DECODE (This design requires more RAMB36/FIFO cells than are available in Pblock 'DECODE'. This design requires 2 of such cell types but no compatible site is available in Pblock 'DECODE'. Please consider increasing the span of Pblock 'DECODE' or removing cells from it.)
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-3#4 Warning
Resource utilization  - PBlock:DECODE1
RAMB36/FIFO over-utilized in Pblock DECODE1 (This design requires more RAMB36/FIFO cells than are available in Pblock 'DECODE1'. This design requires 2 of such cell types but no compatible site is available in Pblock 'DECODE1'. Please consider increasing the span of Pblock 'DECODE1' or removing cells from it.)
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-3#5 Warning
Resource utilization  - PBlock:GBE_arp_ping_UDP
RAMB36/FIFO over-utilized in Pblock GBE_arp_ping_UDP (This design requires more RAMB36/FIFO cells than are available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. This design requires 8 of such cell types but no compatible site is available in Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP'. Please consider increasing the span of Pblock 'GBE_arp_ping_UDP' or removing cells from it.)
